# GraphAI
A graph database for machine learning

The main challenge of training neural networks is to to have enough data! There are many codes which implement deep networks, for example, but not so many codes which generate data... 

This project is about creating a repository of graphs: mostly 2D graphs found in scientific publications and automatically extract from them a number of features: length of x- and y-axis, dimension of x- and y-axis, degree of polynomial or spline interpolation to reproduce the data points shown et cetera. 

The problem: there would be huge copyright issues if I would simple copy and paste existing graphs from scientific journals. Hence this repository recreates graphs using Matplotlib and other science tools and uses them as training basis.
